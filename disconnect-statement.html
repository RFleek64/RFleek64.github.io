  <h1>Artist’s Statement – <em>Disconnect</em></h1>
  <p><strong>by Robert Fleek</strong></p>

  <p><em>Disconnect</em> is an interactive fiction game created in Twine using the Harlowe story format. It explores the digital overload that many college students face — the overwhelming amount of notifications, screen time, academic pressure, social obligations, and the resulting impact on mental health. This game is inspired by my own experiences as a student navigating burnout, distraction, and the search for balance. I wanted to create something that felt honest but also playable, reflective without being heavy-handed.</p>

  <p>The game takes place over the course of two full days in the life of a college student. Every decision you make — whether it's waking up early to help a roommate or staying up late doomscrolling on your phone — shapes your stats and affects how your story ends. Some choices are clear-cut, while others present more realistic, morally gray situations. The goal was not to create a simple good/bad binary, but rather to reflect how small behaviors compound into consequences, both healthy and harmful.</p>

  <p>I designed <em>Disconnect</em> to blend humor, realism, and subtle horror. There’s a light, often sarcastic tone to much of the writing — especially in the student’s internal thoughts — but I also included a hidden horror route triggered by scanning a “forbidden” QR code. This unlocks a storyline involving a mysterious app called <strong>Signal</strong>, which builds tension throughout the game with glitchy visuals, eerie text, and unsettling passages. It’s a metaphor for how intrusive and unsettling technology can feel when it begins to control your routine instead of support it.</p>

  <p>The game includes multiple endings that reflect different approaches to surviving college life: mindfulness, self-improvement, social connection, rest, total collapse, and neutrality. Each of these endings is designed to feel emotionally consistent with the choices that led there. For example:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>CalmEnding:</strong> meditation and mindful choices</li>
    <li><strong>SelfImprovementEnding:</strong> high grades, structure, and personal discipline</li>
    <li><strong>SignalEnding:</strong> addiction to screens, obsession with Signal</li>
    <li><strong>TerriblePersonEnding:</strong> selfishness and indifference on Day 1</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Technical Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Over 90 passages</li>
    <li>More than 5 gameplay variables (mental, sleep, screen time, GPA, social)</li>
    <li>Custom CSS for dark mode, link hover effects, and glitch visuals</li>
    <li>10+ Twine macros (e.g., <code>(if:)</code>, <code>(set:)</code>, <code>(link:)</code>, <code>(text-style:)</code>)</li>
    <li>Dynamic second-day content and side quests</li>
    <li>Several distinct endings with their own visual styles</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I also spent time styling the visuals to match the theme. The base game uses a dark mode color palette with teal accents, which makes it easier on the eyes and matches the calm-yet-digital tone. Signal-based passages use red, flickering text to visually differentiate the horror path. Each ending reflects its mood visually — soft fade-in for calm, bold for improvement, blur for rest, and gray tones for neutrality.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, <em>Disconnect</em> is about awareness. It’s not a lecture on how to live perfectly or a gamified self-help tool. It’s more like a digital mirror — something that lets players experiment with their decisions, recognize patterns in their behavior, and maybe think a little more deeply about the systems we’re caught up in. I hope that players will find some part of themselves in it — whether that’s in the burnout, the attempts to improve, or the choice to simply log off and rest.</p>

  <p><strong>Thanks for playing.</strong></p>
