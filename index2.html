    <h1>My Digital Projects</h1>

    <h2>Cybersecurity Awareness Training</h2>
    <p>One of my key projects involved developing cybersecurity training materials for a medical laboratory in Botswana. The project focused on risk assessment and implementing security policies.</p>

    <h2>Point of Sale System Development</h2>
    <p>As part of my SDLC course, I worked on designing an inventory management system for a local hardware store's new POS system. This involved creating data flow diagrams and process documentation.</p>
