Artist’s Statement – Disconnect by Robert Fleek
Disconnect is an interactive fiction game created in Twine using the Harlowe story format. It explores the digital overload that many college students face — the overwhelming amount of notifications, screen time, academic pressure, social obligations, and the resulting impact on mental health. This game is inspired by my own experiences as a student navigating burnout, distraction, and the search for balance. I wanted to create something that felt honest but also playable, reflective without being heavy-handed.

The game takes place over the course of two full days in the life of a college student. Every decision you make — whether it's waking up early to help a roommate or staying up late doomscrolling on your phone — shapes your stats and affects how your story ends. Some choices are clear-cut, while others present more realistic, morally gray situations. The goal was not to create a simple good/bad binary, but rather to reflect how small behaviors compound into consequences, both healthy and harmful.

I designed Disconnect to blend humor, realism, and subtle horror. There’s a light, often sarcastic tone to much of the writing — especially in the student’s internal thoughts — but I also included a hidden horror route triggered by scanning a “forbidden” QR code. This unlocks a storyline involving a mysterious app called "Signal," which builds tension throughout the game with glitchy visuals, eerie text, and unsettling passages. It’s a metaphor for how intrusive and unsettling technology can feel when it begins to control your routine instead of support it.

The game includes multiple endings that reflect different approaches to surviving college life: mindfulness, self-improvement, social connection, rest, total collapse, and neutrality. Each of these endings is designed to feel emotionally consistent with the choices that led there. For example, if the player consistently prioritizes meditation and healthy mental choices, they unlock the CalmEnding. If they push themselves hard to get good grades and maintain discipline, they’ll receive the SelfImprovementEnding. And if they ignore others, get addicted to their phone, and follow the Signal path, they’ll end up Consumed by the Signal — a glitch-heavy horror ending.

From a technical standpoint, the game uses:

Over 40 passages

More than 5 gameplay variables (mental, sleep, screen time, GPA, social)

Custom CSS for styling and link hover effects

10+ different macros and interactive effects, including (if:), (set:), (link:), (display:), (text-style:), and conditional branching

A full second day of new content and side quests

A humorous “Terrible Person” ending on Day 1 if the player makes consistently selfish or harmful decisions

I also spent time styling the visuals to match the theme. The base game uses a dark mode color palette with teal accents, which makes it easier on the eyes and matches the calm-yet-digital tone. Signal-based passages use red, flickering text to visually differentiate the horror path from the main gameplay. Each ending also has its own style — soft fade-in for calm, bold confidence for improvement, blur for rest, and gray tones for neutrality.

Ultimately, Disconnect is about awareness. It’s not a lecture on how to live perfectly or a gamified self-help tool. It’s more like a digital mirror — something that lets players experiment with their decisions, recognize patterns in their behavior, and maybe think a little more deeply about the systems we’re caught up in. I hope that players will find some part of themselves in it — whether that’s in the burnout, the attempts to improve, or the choice to simply log off and rest.

Thanks for playing.
